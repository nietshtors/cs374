  * `fork()` and variables, local and global

* `fork()` and the system file table

* `pipe()` for interprocess communication

  ```
  int pfd[2];

  pipe(pfd);

  // Now we have a pipe
  ```

* Group exercise 1: using `pipe()`

* `dup()` for duplicating file descriptors

* Group exercise 2: using `pipe()` and `dup()`


---


* Group exercise 1:

  Write a program that transfers the string of your
  choice through a pipe.

  Call `pipe()` to make the pipe first.

  The program should `write()` the data into the
  write-end of the pipe, then `read()` the data out of
  the read-end of the pipe.

  After you read it, print it out to make sure you've
  read it correctly.

---

* Group exercise 2:

  Write a program that sends everything from standard
  output into a pipe.

  You should be able to `write(1, buf, count)` and have
  it go into the pipe. Use `dup()` to wire it up!

  What if we call pipe() to make the pipe fds
    Then I close fd 1 (stdout)
    Then I dup the write end of the pipe
    the write end gets dup'd to fd 1 (stdout)
    subsequent write(1...'s will write into the pipe!

  Then read the data from the read-end of the pipe.

  Try it with `printf()`, which goes to standard
  output. Does it still work?
