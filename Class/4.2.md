* CPU Cache
  * What does this do?
  * Keeps commonly accessed memory close to the
    CPU

  * The general assumption: you're going to
    access subsequent bytes after this one.

  * A common failure:
    * Accessing a 2D array

* Multicore Cache Coherency
  * Fences, acquire/release preview

* File Operations

  * You can open files in different modes:
    * Second argument to `open()`
    * `open("foo.txt", O_RDWR)`  read and write
    * `open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY)`  read only
    * `open("foo.txt", O_WRONLY)`  write only

  * When creating a file:
    Create a file for 644 permissions
    rw-r--r--

    `open("foo.txt", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY, 0644)`

  * You can position yourself in a file, where
    the next read or write will be:

    `lseek()` does this

    `lseek(fd, 1234, SEEK_SET)` 1234 from the start

* Group Exercise: Mess with multiple processes
  and files

  Write program that:

  * Opens a file for writing

    ```
    #include <fcntl.h>
    open("foo.txt", O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_WRONLY, 0644)
    ```

  * Creates a child process
  * Both parent and child write 10000 letters
    to the file.
    * The parent writes 10000 letter 'P's
    * The child writes 10000 letter 'C's
  * Then both exit
