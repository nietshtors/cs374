1) What is the kernel?
	The core of the OS that manages resources under the hood.
2) How is it different than the UI and utility programs?
	The user interacts with both the UI and utility programs which ask the kernel to do work on their behalf.
3) What are the main functions of the kernel?
	The kernel manages physical hardware and logical resources. It provides an API to access those resources in the form of functions known as system calls.
4) What is virtualization?
	Each program thinks it has the machine to itself, but it is actually using virtual resources that are managed by the kernel.
5) How would life be different without virtualization?
	Each program would need to know what resources every other program is using so as to not overwrite something or try to access the same thing at the same time.
