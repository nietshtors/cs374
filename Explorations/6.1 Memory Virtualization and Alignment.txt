When it comes to memory virtualization, what parts are the CPU's job? What parts are the OS's job?
    The CPU can raise exceptions if a process goes outside the bounds of its memory. The OS controls how virtual memory gets mapped to physical memory.
What happens when a process tries to read outside of its virtual address space?
    The CPU raises an exception and gives control back to the OS. The OS likely then kills the process.
What are some of the drawbacks of memory virtualization with base/bounds?
    It may be eaiser for a process to reach outside its bounds. Memory allocation isn't space efficient and can't be changed easily.
