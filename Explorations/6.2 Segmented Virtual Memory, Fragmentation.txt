How did instructions on the VAX specify the segment?
    The address space is chopped into segments based on the top few bits of the virtual address.
What advantages does the segmented memory scheme have over vanilla base/bound?
    Processes can dynamically grow.
What kinds of problems does fragmentation cause?
    Satisfying a memory allocation can be difficult when an amount of memory is spread out across a number of segments.
